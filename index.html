                      Began my post-graduation career as the Release Manager for the Abercrombie &

                      A little over a year into my release management role at A&F I made the 
                      switch to scrummaster for one of the development teams within eCommerce. 
                      Coached the team on scrum, kanban, and agile principles, and led them 
                      through all of the ceremonies including daily standups, retros, and 
                      planning sessions for each sprint.

                      A few months into the scrummaster role I decided I wanted to get back into a 
                      technical role. I began taking online courses through different resources 
                      including 
                      <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a>

                      among others. I taught myself the languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and 
                      JavaScript.

                      I expressed interest to A&F in becoming a developer and they allowed me to 
                      split my responsibilities between scrummaster and developer. I completed 
                      bugfixes and other smaller development tickets. I gained experience working 
                      with other technologies as well including JSP, JSON, HBS, and SCSS.

                  Through all these different roles and experiences I believe it has left me with 
                  a unique blended skillset of leadership skills and technical skills. I am now 
                  searching for a full-time position in front-end web-development. You can see a 
                  portfolio of projects I have completed in the projects section and if you are 
                  interested in hiring me my contact info can be found under the contact section.
